# CodeForces-800
This repository contains codeforces 800 level problems solutions with explainations to help beginners to understand the questions better and build logic faster by analysing <i>800 level</i> <b>Codeforces</b> problemset. Each problem solution will have the following features,
<ul>
  <li><b>Question Summarization:</b> Summarizing the problem while explaining what it actually wants us to code.</li>
  <li><b>Logic Building:</b> Breaking down the problem step by step and building logic along with it. This will help building logic for harder problems more efficiently.</li>
  <li><b>Code Explanation:</b> Each important aspects of the solution code will be explained in steps. It is a very important part to learn in order to get into competitive programming. It is recommanded not to skip.</li>
</ul>

## Pre-requisite Skills
<ul>
  <li> Basic knowledge of the coding language, <b><l>Python</l></b>.</li>
  <li> Know how to run <b>Interactive Python Notebook</b> (.ipynb) files whether locally using Jupyter Notebook on  VSCode, Spyder or using Google Collab.</li>
</ul>
